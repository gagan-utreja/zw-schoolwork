This repo encompasses homework and coursework completed as part of my undergraduate education. It serves as a source of reference, demonstration (or development, hopefully) of skill, and one more thing whose backing up I don't have to worry about.

Do note that some assignments may have incomplete or incorrect implementations. YMMV.

**Please don't cheat. It's not cool.**

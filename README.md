Checking out the project
------------------------


	git clone https://github.com/zwaldowski/ProjectTeamRocket.git
	
Also check out using the GitHub app on [Mac](github-mac://openRepo/https://github.com/zwaldowski/ProjectTeamRocket) or using the [Windows App](http://windows.github.com/).

After checking out, you'll have the *project root* `ProjectTeamRocket` and within that the *project folder* `FindMyThings` folder. You can put anything you want into `ProjectTeamRocket`, but only code should go in `FindMyThings` because Eclipse has emotional problems.

You should, now, be able to import the project into Eclipse by using File > Importâ€¦ > General > Existing Projects into Workspace and selecting the *project root* of the repo (`ProjectTeamRocket`) as the root directory. FindMyThings will appear in the Projects box, make sure it's checked. Make sure "Copy project into workspace" and "Add project to working sets" are UNCHECKED. Hit next and you should be cool.
